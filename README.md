Besides the issue of this being drastically late, I finally feel like I am understanding all of this now. I had some issues with little stuff like forgetting quotes and stuff but I think all that will come with practice.

I did not use any outside resources for this assignment. 

Again, I do apologize for this being so late. I know you have to take off points as you can. But with this assignment and class today 10/11, I feel better. Thanks.
